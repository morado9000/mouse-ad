                  <p>We've been in the valley for 32 years, serving our neighbors and the city at large. We've started in a small one room office, with our only buisness being the locals. Our computer mice would then be popularized through word of mouth, and as that growed so did our team and workspace. Now we're a countrywide titan in the computer mouse buisness, but we will never forget our local roots.</p>
